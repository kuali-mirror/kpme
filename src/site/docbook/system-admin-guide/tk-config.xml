    <title>TimeKeeping Configuration</title>
    <para>This chapter discusses all rules and configurations for Timekeeping module of KPME. All

        <title>Clock Location Rule</title>
        <para>This feature enables administrates to define approved IP addresses for clock entry.
            Clock location rules can be set system wide, or as granular as a specific employee job
            record. The most specific rule for that assignment will be enforced. </para>
        <note>
            <para>A clock location rule will not restrict the clock action from an unapproved IP but
                will add a note to the timesheet that the clock action was from an "unapproved
                location".</para>
        </note>
        <para>Regardless of a rule, the IP address is captured on every clock action and can be seen
            in the Clock Log Inquiry page.</para>
        <para> Table below shows fields used to record and maintain a clock location rule along with
            their description.</para>
