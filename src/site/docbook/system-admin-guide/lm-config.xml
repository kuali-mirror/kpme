    <title>Leave Management Configuration</title>
	<para>This chapter discusses the configuration of key leave management business objects. The order in which the sections are presented are
		important in that they generally build on each other. That is, to configure an accrual category, a leave plan should already be configured.
		While it is possible to configure a leave plan at the time of accrual category configuration, such a configuration would lead to documentation hopping
		if the reader is not already well acquainted with leave plan configuration requirements. Thus it is recommended to read this chapter in the order presented.
	</para>
	<para>
		The reader should also be familiar with the concepts discussed in the chapter "Basic Setup" in order to test the configurations presented in this chapter.

			<para>With a maximum carry over limit defined, the balance for an accrual category will automatically be adjusted when submitting a calendar containing the last day of the calendar year. This day is derived from the leave plan defined on the accrual category to which this rule is attached.

					<para>When defined with a Leave-Approve Action, the adjustment amounts for both carryover and leave-approve actions are calculated relative to the same ending balance;
						the balance as of the last day of the leave plan’s calendar year. Up to four adjustment leave blocks are created with status requested, a maximum of three coming from 
						the balance transaction and the fourth coming from the carryover adjustment.</para>
					<para>If the max balance action is approved, the requested leave block containing the adjustment amount for carryover is re-calculated to reflect the resulting balance. 
					If the max balance action is disapproved, the requested adjustment amount for carryover needs no correction.</para>

With the exception of the On-Demand frequency, these transactions are triggered automatically, with respect to the frequency set within the accrual category’s rules. 
	When the balance of an accrual category has been found to be in excess of the maximum limit defined within its rules, a warning will appear on exempt employees’ leave calendars, non-exempt leave eligible employees’ time calendars, and will also appear on the employee’s approval row within the time and leave approval tabs.

			<title>Transaction Types</title>
			<para>Three transactions are available by default in KPME Leave Management. Transfer, Payout and Lose. Each transaction type has differences, some subtle, in their look and feel and in their execution.  Transfer and Payout are very similar to each other in most regard, whereas the Lose action is noticeably different. Here we examine each transaction type, including submission walkthroughs and comparisons.</para>
			<section>
				<title>Lose</title>
				<para>This transaction forfeits unused leave and may occur with leave-approve or year-end frequencies.</para>
				<para>If the balance of an accrual category is over its limit as of the last day of the leave period, when the employee clicks the “Submit for Approval” button, they will be presented with a simple dialog to confirm forfeiture of leave in excess of this limit.</para>
				<para>To confirm the loss, click “Forfeit”. Otherwise, click cancel to return to the calendar. Once the loss is confirmed, a single approved usage leave block will be created on the calendar in an amount equal to the forfeited amount, and the calendar will immediately resume submission for approval.</para>
				<para>Lose actions do no require approval by department admins.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Transfer</title>
				<para>This transaction moves leave from one accrual category to another at a pre-determined rate. Transfer may occur with any of the three provided frequencies. As with the Lose transaction, a Transfer action is triggered upon calendar submission when the balance for an accrual category is found to be in excess as of the last day of the leave period.</para>
				<para>
					Instead of a dialog, the Employee is redirected to a page containing solely the transfer form. This form is identical to the form presented with On-Demand frequencies, but is not contained within a dialog box.
					Once this form is submitted and correctly validated, up to three leave blocks are created on the calendar belonging to the document id listed on the form. Each block is created with a “requested” status, one for the transfer amount, amount transferred (adjusted for any conversion factor) and, if there exists, forfeiture. The calendar then resumes normal submission, and the Employee is redirected back to the submitted calendar.
					All Transfer actions require approval by department admins
				</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Payout</title>
				<para>This transaction moves leave from an accrual category into an earn code that can be used by payroll to add to salary or wages. Payout may occur with any of the three provided frequencies. As with Transfer and Lose actions, a Payout action can be triggered upon submission of a calendar, and follows the same basic flow. All Payout actions require approval by department admins.</para>
