			<para>With a maximum carry over limit defined, the balance for an accrual category will automatically be adjusted when submitting a calendar containing the last day of the calendar year. This day is derived from the leave plan defined on the accrual category to which this rule is attached.
			This adjustment is achieved by placing a leave block in an amount of the adjustment on the employee’s calendar.</para>

						<para>The adjustment amounts for both carryover and leave-approve actions are calculated relative to the same ending balance; the balance as of the last day of the leave plan’s calendar year. Up to four adjustment leave blocks are created with status requested, a maximum of three coming from the balance transaction and the fourth coming from the carryover adjustment.</para>
						<para>If the max balance action is approved, the requested leave block containing the adjustment amount for carryover is re-calculated to reflect the resulting balance. If the max balance action is disapproved, the requested adjustment amount for carryover needs no correction.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>When defined with a Year-End Action</para>

With the exception of the On-Demand frequency, these transactions are triggered automatically, with respect to the frequency set within the accrual category’s rules. 
	When the balance of an accrual category has been found to be in excess of the maximum limit defined within its rules, a warning will appear on exempt employees’ leave calendars, non-exempt leave eligible employees’ time calendars, and will also appear on the employee’s approval row within the time and leave approval tabs.

If no such action occurs before the end of the period or a rule change, the button becomes disabled.</para>
				<para>To execute an on-demand balance transaction, employee's must:</para>
				<orderedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>Click the enabled button to be presented with a max balance action form. The form will look similar to this:</para>
						<para>Figure 2 The pre-filled values represent the minimum amount needed to bring the balance back to its limit, with a maximized transaction amount which minimizes loss. If there is forfeiture, the transfer amount cannot be increased.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Review the values in the form, and adjust the transaction amount if desired. If the transaction amount is changed, the other values will be updated after the form is submitted. If there is an error in the transaction amount field, they will be prompted to fix it. </para>
						<para>Figure 3. Since there was forfeiture in the original form, the maximum transfer amount (10) had already been achieved. Forfeiture can only be reduced through usage, donation, or other means.</para>
					</listitem>
				</orderedlist>

				<title>Year-End</title>
				<para>Year-end frequency transactions are identical to leave-approve transactions, however, are triggered only if</para>
				<orderedlist numeration="lowerroman">
					<listitem>
						<para>The accrued balance is found to be in excess of the max balance limit as defined by the rule in effect as of the last day of the final leave period in the leave plan’s calendar year.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>This day is within the calendar being submitted for approval.</para>
					</listitem>
				</orderedlist>
				<para>In such a case, employees will be prompted to submit the transaction in a similar fashion to leave-approve transactions.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Leave Approve</title>
				<para>Transactions with this frequency occur when an employee submits a calendar. If the accrued balance as of the last day of a leave period is found to be in excess of its maximum limits and this day is within the calendar being submitted, the employee will be prompted to submit the transaction prior to the calendar being routed for approval.</para>
				<note>For non-exempt leave eligible employees if the calendar does not include the last day of the leave period, a warning will continue to display, but no transaction will be triggered upon submission.</note>

			<title>Transaction Types</title>
			<para>Three transactions are available by default in KPME Leave Management. Transfer, Payout and Lose. Each transaction type has differences, some subtle, in their look and feel and in their execution.  Transfer and Payout are very similar to each other in most regard, whereas the Lose action is noticeably different. Here we examine each transaction type, including submission walkthroughs and comparisons.</para>
			<section>
				<title>Lose</title>
				<para>This transaction forfeits unused leave and may occur with leave-approve or year-end frequencies.</para>
				<para>If the balance of an accrual category is over its limit as of the last day of the leave period, when the employee clicks the “Submit for Approval” button, they will be presented with a simple dialog to confirm forfeiture of leave in excess of this limit.</para>
				<para>To confirm the loss, click “Forfeit”. Otherwise, click cancel to return to the calendar. Once the loss is confirmed, a single approved usage leave block will be created on the calendar in an amount equal to the forfeited amount, and the calendar will immediately resume submission for approval.</para>
				<para>Lose actions do no require approval by department admins.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Transfer</title>
				<para>This transaction moves leave from one accrual category to another at a pre-determined rate. Transfer may occur with any of the three provided frequencies. As with the Lose transaction, a Transfer action is triggered upon calendar submission when the balance for an accrual category is found to be in excess as of the last day of the leave period.</para>
				<para>
					Instead of a dialog, the Employee is redirected to a page containing solely the transfer form. This form is identical to the form presented with On-Demand frequencies, but is not contained within a dialog box.
					Once this form is submitted and correctly validated, up to three leave blocks are created on the calendar belonging to the document id listed on the form. Each block is created with a “requested” status, one for the transfer amount, amount transferred (adjusted for any conversion factor) and, if there exists, forfeiture. The calendar then resumes normal submission, and the Employee is redirected back to the submitted calendar.
					All Transfer actions require approval by department admins
				</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Payout</title>
				<para>This transaction moves leave from an accrual category into an earn code that can be used by payroll to add to salary or wages. Payout may occur with any of the three provided frequencies. As with Transfer and Lose actions, a Payout action can be triggered upon submission of a calendar, and follows the same basic flow. All Payout actions require approval by department admins.</para>

		<section>
			<title>Balance Transaction Approval</title>
			<para>With the exception of the Lose action, all balance transactions must go through the approval process. When a max balance action is taken by an employee,
				KPME automatically routes the document to the employee's approver. At that time, the document will become available in the approvers action list, as well as in document search.
