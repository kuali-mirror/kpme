        <div style="margin-left: 10px;padding-bottom: 25px; padding-top: 10px;">
            All active Faculty who are going up for P&T have access to eDossier by default. To access eDossier:

            <ol>
                <li>Log into OneStart using your IU Username and Passphrase.</li>
                <li>Click on the "<strong>Services &gt; Administrative Systems &gt; Academic</strong>" section.</li>
                <li>An "<strong>eDossier System</strong>" channel will appear.</li>
                <li>Click on the "<strong>eDossier Application</strong>" link to access the application.<br>
                	<img src="images/accessing_dossier.png" vspace="10px">
                
                </li>
                
            </ol>
           <strong>Getting Started:</strong> Click on the <strong>"Dossiers" tab</strong> and then on the <strong>"View Dossier" button</strong>. This will 
            open up the dossier menu &#45; the P&T Checklist &#45; on the left pane. Clicking on the arrows > expands each section further. <br>
            
            <strong>Logging out:</strong> To logout of eDossier, click on the <strong>"Logout"</strong> button located on the top right hand
            corner. For complete CAS logout, click the "CAS logout" button.

        </div>

        <a name="delegate"><strong>B. Delegates and Guests</strong></a>
        <div style="margin-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 25px; padding-top: 10px;">
            P&T guidelines state that "responsibility for assembling the dossier belongs to the department 
            chair or dean (in non-departmentalized schools), who works closely with the candidate to ensure 
            that all pertinent materials listed on the checklist are included in the proper categories‚Äù. 
            However, candidates may appoint a <strong>delegate</strong> (e.g., a support staff) to assist in preparing the eDossier. 
            The delegate may, for example, help upload files and populate various checklist categories. Ultimate 
            responsibility for the contents and submission of the eDossier remain with the candidate and the 
            chair/dean who "sign-off"on the checklist. The delegate may <u>not</u> submit the eDossier.
            
            <p>To assign a delegate:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Click "<strong>Assign a Candidate Delegate</strong>" link, located at the top of the left-hand menu pane.</li>
                <li>Enter the "<strong>IU Username</strong>" of the delegate and click the "<strong>search</strong>" button.</li>
                <li>The name of the person should show upon the "<strong>Name</strong>" field.</li>
                <li>If desired, you can enter a "<strong>Start and EndDate</strong>" during which time the delegate has
                    access to your eDossier.  With or without start/end dates, click the "<strong>save</strong>" button to
                    establish your delegate until you remove/delete them.</li>
                <li>To delete delegate access, click the delete button under the "Action" column to remove their access to your eDossier. 
                Note: Delegate permissions automatically expire once the dossier has been formally submitted (see Section D).</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><strong>Naming a Guest:</strong> </p>
            
            <p>Candidates may also allow guest access. After logging in, on the upper left side of the window, click 
            on "Assign a Guest". A guest has <u>view only access</u>. This role may be useful if, for example, you are asking 
            a colleague or mentor to review your dossier. </p>
            
            <p><strong>How does a Delegate access a candidate's eDossier?</strong></p>

            <p>A delegate accesses the eDossier System via OneStart (see "Accessing eDossier" above). After
            logging in and clicking on the "Dossiers" tab, the delegate will see the "Candidate" name appear.
            Clicking on the "View Dossier" button of the candidate will then open up the candidate's eDossier in the left-hand menu pane.</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 25px; padding-top: 10px;">

        <p style="line-height: 1.3em; padding-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong>Navigating:</strong> In the left-hand menu pane, click the arrows > to expand sections. Clicking the arrow 
        on an already expanded section will collapse it.  </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.3em; padding-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong>Uploading Files:</strong> To add files to a category (e.g., Candidate Statements), click on the category in the 
        left-hand menu pane. The right-hand page will open and the upload option will become visible. To upload files, 
        "drag and drop"them or manually "browse and click upload file" from your local file location. <strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are using 
        Internet Explorer as your browser, you have to select it manually and then click the "Upload File" button. <br>
        <img src="images/file_upload.png" vspace="10px">
        </p>
        
		<p style="line-height: 1.3em; padding-bottom: 8px;">
		<strong>Sorting/Reordering Files:</strong> If you have multiple files in a particular category, you may wish to reorder 
		them (i.e., create a particular sequence). To do so, select a file and simply drag it up or down in the list. 
				 
        <p style="line-height: 1.3em; padding-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong>TIP #1:</strong> Good files names are essential for you to manage your eDossier, but also
        essential to accessibility by reviewers. File names should make sense and be reflective of
        the content (e.g., MyResearchStatement.pdf). While eDossier is designed to handle
        multiple file formats (e.g., PDF), certain formats require particular applications to open
        the file. If you have a particular file format that might require a special software, you may
        want to make sure to provide special instructions to your department once you submit
        your dossier.</p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.3em; padding-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong>Deleting Files:</strong> To delete a file, select the file and check it in the "Mark"column. 
        Click on the "Actions"button and select <strong>Delete</strong> from the drop-down menu. To confirm, click on the 
        message to delete or cancel the request.</p>

		<p style="line-height: 1.3em; padding-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong>Replacing Files:</strong> To replace a file, select <strong>Replace</strong> from the drop-down menu next 
        to the document. A dialog box will appear, allowing you to upload a new version in the place of 
        the old document by clicking the <strong><i>Browse</strong></i> button, selecting the appropriate file, and clicking <strong><i>Upload File</i></strong>.<br>

        <p style="line-height: 1.3em; padding-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong>Embedding URLs &#45; Linking 2 Documents:</strong> Within a file, you may sometimes want to point reviewers to another document/file 
        in your dossier. For example, within your teaching statement, you might want to point reviewers to a particular syllabus you previously 
        uploaded. Via the <strong>copy URL feature</strong>, you can embed the link to the syllabus directly in your statement so reviewers can easily access it. 
        
        <p>
        	<ol>
        		<li>Select the previously uploaded document you want to link to using the <strong><i>Copy Link</i></strong> option in 
        		the drop down menu next to the uploaded document.<br>
        		<img src="images/embed_url.png" vspace="10px">
        		</li>
        		<li>A dialog box will now appear with the appropriate URL. Copy the URL to your clipboard.<br>
        		<img src="images/copy_url_to_clipboard.png" vspace="10px">
        		</li>
        		<li>Paste the copied URL into the relevant document before uploading it to your dossier. 
        		Here a two examples of ways to include the URL in your file: 
 					<br><br>
 					<ol>
 						<li>
                            "This is my research statement. I want to note a very important paper that examines the relationship
                            between a and b. The paper may be found here:
                            <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">https://uisapp2.iu.edu/edo-prd/EdoDownloadFile.do?itemID=546</span>"
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            "This is my research statement. I want to note a very important <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">paper</span>
                            that examines the relationship between a and b." [Note here, the word 'paper' has the hyperlink attached to it].
                        </li>
 					</ol>
 					<br>       		
       	
        		</li>
        		<li>Save the document to your computer or server and upload as normal. When a reviewer opens the document from within e-dossier, 
        		clicking on the URL link will direct the system (and reader) to the linked file. </li>
        	</ol>

        	<p style="line-height: 1.3em; padding-bottom: 8px;">
	        When you have completed your e-Dossier, the next step is to "submit" it to your department 
	        (or unit) chair. S/he is responsible for "signing off" on your P&T Checklist. That is, after review, your chair will either 
	        "return" the e-dossier to you for further development or "sign off" and route it to the first level of review. At this point, your accepted 
	        eDossier will advance automatically (using IU's workflow system) to review bodies. </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.3em; padding-bottom: 8px;">
        Note: <u>Each</u> sub-folder in the "General" section of your dossier must have at least one file uploaded before the "Submit"button 
        option becomes visible to you.</p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.3em; padding-bottom: 8px;">
        If you submit your eDossier in error, please contact <a href="mailto:edossier@indiana.edu">edossier@indiana.edu</a> for assistance.</p>

   		<div style="margin-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 25px; padding-top: 10px;">
   		
	        <p style="line-height: 1.3em; padding-bottom: 8px;">
	        Once your eDossier is routed and under review, it is essentially frozen. However, 
	        additional materials (e.g., new publications, awards etc.) may be added by using the "Supplemental Items"folder at the bottom of the left menu. 
	        This folder is activated and becomes visible to you once your department chair has signed off on the checklist and the review process has begun. 
	        New items will be date-stamped.</p>

   		<div style="margin-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 25px; padding-top: 10px;">
   		
	        <p style="line-height: 1.3em; padding-bottom: 8px;">
	        External letters, internal evaluative letters, and vote records are not viewable by 
	        the candidate at any time during the review process. Access to any evaluative materials is managed outside the e-dossier system and according 
	        to policy and local practices. </p>
