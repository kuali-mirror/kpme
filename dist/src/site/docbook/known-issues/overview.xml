    <title>Statement Regarding Known Issues</title>
    <para>
        As an open source community based software project, KPME wishes to be transparent about known issues with the software at each release.  Publically 
        providing an exhaustive list of known issues is a deviation from common practice for commercially provided software.  We believe it important to allow 
        our colleagues who might consider adopting the software to make as fully informed decision as possible, to limit surprises that would be encountered 
        during implementation and to eliminate the expenditure of unnecessary time discovering and confirming issues that are already known.  Those known 
        issues will be attended to in future patches and releases.
