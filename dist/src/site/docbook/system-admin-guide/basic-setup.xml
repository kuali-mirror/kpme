			<title>Earn Code</title>
			<para>The Earn Code maintenance page is used to define codes to categorize employee’s
				hours/earnings and time off. Earn codes define how the employees records time and
				leave blocks on timesheets and leave calendars. Most earn code attributes are
				defined in the payroll system, but there are a few codes which need to be modified
				on the timesheet prior to the data being extracted to payroll. An inflation factor
				and inflate minimum hours value are definable on the earn code document. These
				actions occur on the recorded hours in the timesheet, therefore would NOT need to be
				done in the payroll system. These codes may or may not be attached to an accrual
				category for tracking time against available balances or simple reporting.
				Additionally there are numerous flags on the earn code to limit availability and
				determine eligibility for accrual and scheduling leave. </para>
