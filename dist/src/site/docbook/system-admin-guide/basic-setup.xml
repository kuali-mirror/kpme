			<para>
                The Earn Code maintenance page is used to define codes to categorize employee’s hours/earnings and time off.  For each earn code, you can define 
                how the employees records - in/out time, hours, days or flat dollar amount.  These codes may or may not be attached to an accrual category for
				tracking leave against available balances or simple reporting.  Most earn code attributes are defined in the payroll system, but there are a few 
				codes which need to be modified on the timesheet prior to the data being extracted to payroll.  An inflation factor and inflate minimum hours 
				value are definable on the earn code document.  These actions occur on the recorded hours in the timesheet and therefore would NOT need to be 
				done in the payroll system.  Additionally there are numerous flags on the earn code to limit availability and determine eligibility for accrual 
				and scheduling leave.

				1st of the next month for the same employee.
