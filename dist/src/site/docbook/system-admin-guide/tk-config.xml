    <para>This chapter discusses all rules and configurations for Time keeping module of KPME. All
        rules and configurations can be accessed through maintenance documents listed under the
            <emphasis role="bold">Timekeeping</emphasis> section on the maintenance tab. </para>

        configurations made in the HR and payroll module and therefore cannot be completed without

        <title>Clock Location Rule</title>
        <para>This feature enables administrators to restrict clock entry locations by defining
            approved IP addresses for Timekeeping use. Clock location rules can be set system wide,
            or as granular as a specific employee job record. In case of having more than one valid
            clock location rule for an assignment, the most specific rule for that assignment will be
            enforced by the system. </para>
        <important>
            <para>A clock location rule will not restrict the clock action from an unapproved IP but
                will add a note to the timesheet indicating that the clock action was from an
                "unapproved location".</para>
        </important>
        <para>Regardless of a rule, the IP address is captured on every clock action and can be seen
            on the Clock Log Inquiry page.</para>

        <title>Grace Period Rule</title>
        <para>The Grace Period Rule is an optional rule that results in the system rounding clock
            in/outs times based on the chosen factor. This rule rounds up and down based on the
            clock action time. The benefit of having a grace period rule is that it eliminates small
            fractions of time and makes calculations less complicated for those employees trying to
            reach standard hours for the week. It also alleviates the rush to clock in or out right
            on the hour. </para>

        <title>Shift Differential Rule</title>
        <para>The Shift Differential Rule defines rules for assigning shift differentials. This rule
            applies shift automatically to earn codes when clock times are specified. If an earn
            code is entered with an hours amount (ex: Sick), the rule would not assign shift. Rules
            can be set system wide, or on specific populations (most specific rule for that
            assignment will be enforced). The rule will add a specified earn code to the eligible
            shift hours. Different earn codes are needed to result in different shift amounts (e.g.
            each earn code attached to a shift rule has its own associated rate for payment in
            Payroll). The shift differential rule only assigns the additional earnings codes to
            shift hours within the specified shift time period. Any hours outside of the shift
            period will not be assigned shift.</para>
